Using a [hapi](https://github.com/spumko/hapi) server and [EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) templates, and the [attached data structure](./bands.json), create a page that renders a list of the bands on the left, and when a band name is clicked, the details of that band are displayed to the right of the list.

 * Each band should have its own URL.
 * We're looking for server-side knowledge here, so handle all the logic, routes and views in node.

Use any other node modules, frontend frameworks (Bootstrap), libraries (jQuery) etc. that you'd like.

Bonus points for making the data editable. Extra bonus points for making those changes persist for each user/browser.

This should work on modern desktop (IE9+) and mobile browsers. Feel free to change the UI/UX as you see fit for a good experience on mobile browsers.

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with!
