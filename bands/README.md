This will be focused entirely on Frontend coding. Using Backbone.js [1] as the MVC framework, EJS [2] for JS templates, and the attached [data structure](./bands.js), create a page that renders a list of the bands on the left, and when a band name is clicked, the details of that band are displayed to the right of the list.

Use any other frameworks, jQuery plugins, etc. that you'd like.

Bonus points for managing the browser History object so that each band has a unique url that can be bookmarked. Extra bonus points for making the data editable. Super bonus points for making those changes persistent on the client.

In case you haven't already used Backbone, this should help get you going with a client-side only implementation after you read over the basics:
http://backbonejs.org/#FAQ-bootstrap

Don't worry about it working on anything but modern browsers (IE9 and better), and assuming the user has JS enabled is fine.

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with!
